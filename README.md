## Top 10 New Features in Node.js 21.7

Node.js 21.7 introduces several exciting new features and improvements, enhancing developer productivity and application performance. Here are the top 10 new features, along with examples of how to use them effectively:

1. **Stable ES Modules Support**

Node.js now provides stable support for ECMAScript Modules (ES Modules), the official standard for modularizing JavaScript code. This allows developers to use the `import` and `export` syntax natively, without relying on third-party tools or workarounds.

```js
// app.mjs
import express from 'express';
const app = express();
// ...
```

2. **Diagnostic Reports Enhancements**

Diagnostic reports, which provide detailed information about application crashes and performance issues, have been improved. Developers can now include custom metadata and specify which data to include or exclude in the reports.

```js
process.report.reportOnFatalError = true;
process.report.reportOnUncaughtException = true;
process.report.directory = path.join(__dirname, 'reports');
process.report.signal = 'SIGUSR2';
process.report.metadata = { appVersion: '1.0.0' };
```

3. **Experimental Async Local Storage**

Node.js 21.7 introduces experimental support for Async Local Storage, a mechanism for storing data associated with an asynchronous context. This can be useful for scenarios like request-scoped data in web servers or context propagation in distributed systems.

```js
const { AsyncLocalStorage } = require('node:async_hooks');
const asyncLocalStorage = new AsyncLocalStorage();

const store = asyncLocalStorage.run(new Map(), () => {
  asyncLocalStorage.enterWith(new Map().set('key', 'value'));
  const value = asyncLocalStorage.getStore().get('key');
  console.log(value); // Output: 'value'
});
```

4. **Worker Threads Improvements**

Worker Threads, which allow running JavaScript in parallel, have received several improvements, including better error handling, support for transferring WebAssembly.Memory objects, and the ability to terminate worker threads gracefully.

```js
const { Worker } = require('node:worker_threads');
const worker = new Worker('./worker.js');

worker.on('message', (result) => {
  console.log(`Result: ${result}`);
});

worker.on('error', (err) => {
  console.error(`Error: ${err}`);
});

worker.on('exit', (code) => {
  console.log(`Worker stopped with exit code ${code}`);
});

worker.postMessage({ operation: 'fibonacci', number: 10 });
```

5. **HTTP/2 Server Push**

Node.js 21.7 introduces support for HTTP/2 Server Push, which allows servers to proactively send resources to clients before they are requested, improving page load times and reducing network round trips.

```js
const http2 = require('node:http2');
const fs = require('node:fs');

const server = http2.createServer();

server.on('stream', (stream, headers) => {
  const path = headers[':path'];

  if (path === '/') {
    stream.respondWithFile('./index.html', {
      'content-type': 'text/html',
      'push': {
        root: '.',
        path: '/styles.css',
        headers: {
          'content-type': 'text/css'
        }
      }
    });
  } else if (path === '/styles.css') {
    stream.respondWithFile('./styles.css', {
      'content-type': 'text/css'
    });
  }
});

server.listen(3000);
```

6. **Experimental Embedding Assets**

Node.js 21.7 introduces experimental support for embedding assets, such as images, fonts, or other static files, directly into the application bundle. This can simplify deployment and improve performance by reducing the number of file system operations.

```js
const { embedAssets } = require('node:sea');

const assets = {
  'logo.png': './assets/logo.png',
  'fonts/': './assets/fonts/'
};

const embedder = embedAssets(assets);

// Access embedded assets
const logoData = embedder.get('logo.png');
const fontData = embedder.get('fonts/roboto.ttf');
```

7. **Native .env File Loading**

Node.js 21.7 introduces native support for loading environment variables from `.env` files, reducing the need for third-party packages like `dotenv`.

```js
// Load environment variables from .env file
process.loadEnvFile();

// Access environment variables
const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
```

8. **Multi-line Values in .env Files**

Node.js 21.7 also supports multi-line values in `.env` files, making it easier to manage complex configurations like certificates or multi-line strings.

```
# .env file
CERTIFICATE="-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIDdTCCAl2gAwIBAgIJAKC1hi9s2wfMMA...
...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----"
```

9. **Improved Test Hooks**

The `t.after()` hook in Node.js 21.7 now runs even if a test has no subtests, allowing developers to clean up resources after each test case.

```js
const test = require('node:test');

test('my test', async (t) => {
  // Set up resources

  t.after(() => {
    // Clean up resources
  });

  // Test assertions
});
```

10. **Updated Dependencies**

Node.js 21.7 updates several dependencies, including nghttp2 (1.60.0), which provides HTTP/2 support, and other security and performance improvements.

These new features and improvements in Node.js 21.7 enhance developer productivity, application performance, and overall development experience. By leveraging these features effectively, developers can build more robust, efficient, and maintainable applications using the latest JavaScript standards and best practices.
